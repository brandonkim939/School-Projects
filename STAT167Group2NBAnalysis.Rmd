**Introduction and project description**
For our project we set out to analyze the impact of pace and location on NBA players and their teams between the 2000-2018 season. Through the use of line graphs, state maps, and linear regression we were able to efficiently analyze the impact of these factors. We use these factors to conduct a deep analysis of the transformation of play style and the effects it had on player position, usage, and efficiency. We analyzed several different factors to see if there was a correlation with winning percentage.

**Data exploration and visualization**
- Used dplyr packages to merge/clean data sets.
- Used step graphs, line graphs, and scatterplots to visualize metrics such as PER, pace, scoring and such.
- Used residual plots and qq-plots to visualize model assumptions for regression analysis.
- Used states map to visualize magnitude of winning percentage per location. 

**Model evaluation and validations**
Conducted linear regressions for the change in pace which is a metric used by the NBA to analyze how fast/volume of shooting in a basketball game (Brandon and Mustafa). We then used pace as an independent variable to check the influence on other metrics such as overall scoring, 3-point shooting, efficiency rating, and usage rate. We then transitioned into to the analysis of team attendance towards salary using multiple linear regression (Kaiyu Sun). We saw the regression fit not holding a lot of strength with low values of R-sq which leads us to our third question. We wanted to visualize a map showing magnitude of location of that NBA team and if we can see a trend in seeing an impact on winning percentage (Dinh Bui). We saw a trend in larger winning percentages teams if they were located in big market locations such as Texas and California.

**Model Evaluation and Validations**
Used typical model assumptions for normality and homogeneity of variances per linear models. Had solid R-sq for the analysis on the single linear regression for question 1. We struggled to find a solid R-sq for the multiple linear regression for salary so we furthered our analysis with a visualization on location as a dependent variable to help predict winning. 

**Conclusions and discussion**
We were able to conclude that there was a strong linear correlation between pace and points and three pointers. We found that once pace improved, we did see that pace had an impact on the usage of different positions but did not affect overall efficiency. Although salary did not translate to a higher win percentage, team location seemed to have a large impact with bigger market teams having a higher overall win percentage.
